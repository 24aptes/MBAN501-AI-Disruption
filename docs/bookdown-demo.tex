\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

From assisting with strategy to generating content, artificial intelligence (AI) is already influencing how businesses operate. The consulting firm Accenture projects an average profitability boost of 38\% by 2035 across sixteen major industries. Additionally, AI has led to increased productivity and reduced costs, particularly in analytics, product development, and customer service. This has led many businesses to adopt AI with large firms like Google and Microsoft potentially investing billions in the technology. It is apparent that AI will provide a new arena for businesses to compete in.

Yet, the excitement over the benefits of AI has yielded challenges for businesses and regulators. For businesses, there are questions on what duties to assign AI. One of the causes of the ongoing actor and writer strikes is concerns over AI replacing human workers. Technology contractors in the Republic of Kenya are suing Meta for being exposed to psychologically damaging content while moderating its generative AI systems. Additionally, the exact information necessary for AI to arrive at optimal solutions is not known. Recent studies have shown there are limits to the effectiveness of pricing algorithms and that data reaches a point of diminishing returns. AI has also proven to be difficult to regulate; governments and institutions face the challenge of controlling something without knowing its full potential. The laws they establish will inevitably provide another dimension to business competition.

As businesses adopt AI, it is crucial to consider both the benefits and challenges to best predict its impact on the competitive landscape. To what degree will businesses rely on these systems and how will their competitors respond? What industries are likely to see the most meaningful change in operations? And what does this mean for the workers within those industries? Acknowledging these questions is the key to developing a business environment that utilizes AI in an efficient, fair, and ethical manner.

We are a team of Master of Business Analytics (MBAn) students with the goal of understand how the new age of generative artificial intelligence (AI) will impact the world, and specifcally, impact our cohort as analytics students. By combining our wide array of backrounds, diverse skillsets, and range of persepctives, we hope to compile a robust report that captures the impact AI will have on all levels of industry.
