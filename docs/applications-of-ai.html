<p>“AI can help to improve customer service by automating routine tasks and providing personalized recommendations.”
Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft</p>
<p>AI has already made significant inroads into customer service, with tools like chatbots and virtual assistants taking on a variety of customer-related tasks. Industry experts are predicting a number of trends in this area. The adoption of AI-powered chatbots is set to rise, with the global chatbot market projected to reach a substantial USD 27,297.2 million by 2030. This growth is expected to occur at a compound annual rate of 23.3% from 2023 to 2030. (Taylor, 2023) The advantages of chatbots are 24/7 availability and efficient handling of inquiries compared to human representatives. As chatbots continue to evolve, they are becoming increasingly sophisticated, capable of addressing both straightforward queries and complex issues. This advancement is proving to be important for customer service teams seeking streamlined interactions.</p>
<p>The progression of AI is also leading to a shift towards more personalized customer experiences. Insights from the State of AI report underscore that people are growing more comfortable with AI’s ability to offer personalized messages (50%) and tailored experiences (46%) (Taylor, 2023). Leveraging customer data, AI is now capable of providing customized product recommendations and interactions that enrich the overall customer journey.</p>
<p>Furthermore, AI’s predictive capabilities are expected to become more advanced. With enhanced accuracy, AI will be able to predict customer behaviors with precision, resulting in improved customer experiences and heightened satisfaction levels. For instance, AI systems can anticipate when a customer is likely to make a purchase based on their historical behavior and interactions. This predictive ability opens the door for timely actions, such as delivering personalized offers at opportune moments.</p>
<p>Debates about AI’s role in customer service will continue. While some analysts envision AI completely replacing human representatives, others anticipate a collaborative relationship between AI and human agents. Research data indicates that by 2024, approximately 61% of customer service professionals will rely on AI or other automated processes. (Taylor, 2023) Although AI excels at handling a diverse range of queries, situations demanding human empathy and understanding are expected to persist. These ongoing discussions reflect the evolving landscape of customer service and the dynamic interplay between technology and human expertise.</p>

<p>“As AI continues to evolve, we can expect to see more intelligent automation in marketing, making it easier and faster to reach our audience. The possibilities are endless, and the future of marketing looks very exciting.”
Neil Patel, Co-founder of NP Digital</p>
<p>The future of AI in marketing holds transformative potential across a range of aspects, extending from enhancing customer engagement to refining content creation strategies. Marketers are actively exploring innovative methods to interact with consumers and leverage the capabilities of AI to their advantage. However, there are disparities in the advancement of this industry, with larger corporations leading AI integration due to their substantial resources and expertise.</p>
<p>Moving into the next decade, substantial advancements and challenges are anticipated in the realm of AI marketing. Firstly, the analysis of consumer behavior through AI-driven methods presents a valuable opportunity for gaining accurate insights into data. This allows marketers to identify trends, optimize their campaigns, and track the return on investment based on a more personalized comprehension of their customers. The potential for real-time inferencing support through AI-powered analytic tools further enhances the effective utilization of consumer data (Wolinsky, 2023).</p>
<p>Moreover, advanced AI systems are positioned to process vast quantities of customer data, interpreting emerging patterns and predicting their evolution in real time (Wolinsky, 2023). This predictive analysis will significantly refine marketing campaigns, granting marketers a higher level of precision when evaluating the effectiveness of their efforts.</p>
<p>Addressing the growing demand for personalized content curation, AI-powered tools are on the rise. These tools can efficiently curate content tailored to specific platforms and products, resulting in reduced lead times and heightened execution accuracy (Wolinsky, 2023). This shift empowers marketers to attain more measurable outcomes, make strategic adjustments, and effectively engage their target audiences.</p>
<p>With the ongoing digital transformation, the need for dependable on-demand customer service has experienced a sharp and significant increase. While automated solutions like chatbots have improved response times, challenges persist in effectively resolving customer concerns. Ongoing development in natural language processing (NLP) models is set to bridge this gap, enhancing the capacity of automated systems to understand and address complex customer queries (Wolinsky, 2023).</p>
<p>Voice recognition technology, in conjunction with AI applications such as Alexa and Siri, is expected to elevate the role of language in marketing. Real-time applications of these technologies can optimize voice searches and enhance the comprehension of natural language, thereby fostering improved communication and engagement with consumers (Wolinsky, 2023). AI-driven automation is set to revolutionize digital marketing workflows. It can improve productivity, manage project deliveries, enhance market insights, and generate more personalized messaging. However, AI does not replace human creativity, which is still essential for the successful execution of these strategies.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Talent Management<a href="applications-of-ai.html#talent-management" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>“Cognitive computing is going to be the next big thing in human resource management. It is going to transform how we hire, train, and retain employees.”
- Ginni Rometty, Former CEO of IBM</p>
<p>Generative AI has the potential to transform recruiting by assisting managers in creating better job requirements and personalizing outreach to candidates. It can identify the skills needed for success in a job, which improves both the speed and quality of the process. Organizations currently struggle to personalize outreach to a large number of applicants. AI can also enhance candidate outreach and communication, making it easier to provide important information to applicants in a more personalized manner (Hancock, 2023).</p>
<p>“With generative AI, you can include much more personalization about the candidate, the job, and what other jobs may be available if there’s a reason the applicant isn’t a fit. All those things are made immensely easier and faster through generative AI.”
- Bryan Hancock</p>
<p>AI’s role in talent evaluation is equally significant, as it can accelerate the shift from credentials to skills-based assessment (Hancock, 2023). The technology’s ability to tag unstructured data for keywords can help identify relevant capabilities and skills, enabling a more inclusive and skills-based approach to candidate evaluation, enriching the pool of potential candidates and promoting a more comprehensive view of skills.</p>
<p>Beyond the initial recruitment phase, AI-driven career development assistance emerges as a valuable resource for employees seeking to navigate their professional paths (Hancock, 2023). AI-powered assistants can guide individuals by offering insights into potential career opportunities, identifying role models, and highlighting necessary skills for advancement. This dynamic interaction facilitates informed decision-making and strategic planning for career growth.</p>
<p>While AI’s potential is considerable, its role in performance review processes is complex. Although AI could play a role in drafting initial performance reviews based on aggregated feedback, the importance of human judgment and empathy in finalizing these reviews remains undeniable (Schaninger, 2023). This emphasizes the interplay between technological support and the inherently human elements of feedback and assessment.</p>
<p>As organizations adopt generative AI tools, leaders need to consider the impact on workflows, collaboration models, and job roles. Proper change management strategies should be employed to maximize the benefits of the technology without disrupting the work ecosystem (Yee, 2023).</p>
<p>“The other thing is there’s a real opportunity for what we typically call ‘change
management.’ If you don’t think through how the technology changes the job, workflow,
or collaboration model, then you’re not necessarily directing that additional time toward
something that’s more value added.”
- Lareina Yee</p>

<div id="alibaba" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.4.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.1</span> Alibaba:<a href="applications-of-ai.html#alibaba" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Alibaba is a Chinese corporation that started out as an e-commerce business back in 1999 and is one of the largest e-commerce websites. Having both a Business to Customer (B2C) arm as well as a Business to Business (B2B) arm, Alibaba has a massive collection of data at its helm. In fact, it has more data than any other retailer, beating Amazon and Walmart.</p>
<p>To achieve this, Alibaba leveraged the use of AI since the very beginning. Back in 2009, to predict the traffic on the website on a festival called Singles Day, Alibaba reinvented its AI algorithm to predict traffic based on the data collected in the previous week. This short-term forecasting strategy helped Alibaba to accurately predict the footfall on the website and thus serve the customers with greater efficiency. This also helped the e-commerce website to tackle the problem of irregular shopping cycles by using predictive analysis of data from the previous weeks to manage the footfall.</p>
<p>Another use-case of AI at Alibaba is its customer service chatbot, AliMe. To shed some light on the numbers, this chatbot responded to 300 million queries in a single day which accounted for 97% of all customer queries. To put the efficiency brought to operational costs into perspective, it would have taken 85,000 human employees to address this volume of queries (ADA editorial, 2022). AliMe has several abilities such as speech recognition, semantic understanding, and personalized recommendations. AliMe also uses deep learning to direct customers to the best-fit product or service.</p>

<div id="amazon" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.4.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.2</span> Amazon:<a href="applications-of-ai.html#amazon" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Amazon is a multinational corporation with several arms including an e-commerce website, a streaming service, and a cloud service. In 2014, Amazon moved towards using deep learning for recommendation engines. This marked the advancement of Amazon towards AI, which is now deeply ingrained in its DNA.</p>
<p>Amazon uses artificial intelligence from the moment a customer gets on its website. Talking about the e-commerce shopping arm, Amazon uses consumer data from several sources to customize the landing page of its website for each of the 300 million users that it caters to (V K, 2022). Using this algorithm, it displays those products that customers are most likely to buy.</p>
<p>Another area where Amazon used widely available data to cater to customers is the development of its own personal assistant, Alexa. Using algorithms such as voice recognition and natural language processing, it first developed Echo, which is a smart home device that shares information through natural conversation. Developing Alexa was a step forward which helped Amazon use natural conversation throughout its platforms, including streaming and music services.</p>

<div id="starbucks" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="4.4.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.3</span> Starbucks:<a href="applications-of-ai.html#starbucks" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Starbucks is the third largest fast food chain in the entire world and is spread over 30,000 locations (V K, 2022). Starbucks started its AI program as late as 2018 when it started to harvest the data made available through the 90 million customer transactions daily throughout the globe.</p>
<p>Using this massive bank of data, Starbucks made better decisions in sales and overall direction of the corporation. A specific use-case was improving their direct marketing technologies such as targeted advertising and personalized drink recommendations. With the data of 13 million customers in its loyalty program, Starbucks began offering customized drinks according to customer preferences (V K, 2022). They also used the widely available data to recommend preferred drinks to customers who have never visited a Starbucks before. Another use-case of AI at Starbucks is the availability of a virtual barista to facilitate the ordering experience.</p>
