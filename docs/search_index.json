The consulting firm Accenture projects an average profitability boost of 38% by 2035 across sixteen major industries. Additionally, AI has led to increased productivity and reduced costs, particularly in analytics, product development, and customer service. This has led many businesses to adopt AI with large firms like Google and Microsoft potentially investing billions in the technology. It is apparent that AI will provide a new arena for businesses to compete in. Yet, the excitement over the benefits of AI has yielded challenges for businesses and regulators. For businesses, there are questions on what duties to assign AI. One of the causes of the ongoing actor and writer strikes is concerns over AI replacing human workers. Technology contractors in the Republic of Kenya are suing Meta for being exposed to psychologically damaging content while moderating its generative AI systems. Additionally, the exact information necessary for AI to arrive at optimal solutions is not known. Recent studies have shown there are limits to the effectiveness of pricing algorithms and that data reaches a point of diminishing returns. AI has also proven to be difficult to regulate; governments and institutions face the challenge of controlling something without knowing its full potential. The laws they establish will inevitably provide another dimension to business competition. As businesses adopt AI, it is crucial to consider both the benefits and challenges to best predict its impact on the competitive landscape. To what degree will businesses rely on these systems and how will their competitors respond? What industries are likely to see the most meaningful change in operations? And what does this mean for the workers within those industries? Acknowledging these questions is the key to developing a business environment that utilizes AI in an efficient, fair, and ethical manner.

"],["impact-of-ai-on-the-competitive-landscape.html", "Chapter 3 Impact of AI on the Competitive Landscape 3.1 “Feedback Loop” 3.2 Competitive AI Across Industries 3.3 Applications of AI 3.4 Major Players’ Use of AI:", " Chapter 3 Impact of AI on the Competitive Landscape 3.1 “Feedback Loop” From customer-targeted advertisements to automated chatbots, AI has found its place in every industry. The excellence of a modern business is often synonymous with the use of AI and related systems in its day-to-day operations. While AI is used in the back end and the front end, it is the customer-centric application of AI that helps businesses to gain a competitive advantage in any industry. A common misconception is that accessibility to data drives competitive advantages for businesses. Even regulators share the perspective that companies amassing large amounts of data can pose barriers for new entrants (Iansiti, 2021). The main concern is that the availability of excess data can result in a “feedback loop”. A feedback loop is formed when the companies with the most data use it to reinforce their decisions and deliver heightened value to their customers. As they grow their customer share, these companies inherit access to even more data, which can be used to make additional derivations. This is particularly true for younger companies, as acquiring data is a useful tool for building the user base necessary to take advantage of network effects. However, deeper research shows that this might not be the case for more mature firms, because the accumulation of data eventually yields diminishing returns. This is especially true when data lacks quality, scalability, or cannot be combined with complementary data. Also important is the degree to which data is exclusive and inimitable. This prevents rival firms from nullifying a data advantage through their own usage. For example, streaming services have been able to use similar data to Netflix to reduce its competitive data advantage. Clearly, the positive feedback loop is not infinite, and the usefulness of data has an implicit ceiling, making it a nuanced issue for regulators to tackle. 3.2 Competitive AI Across Industries With the mass adoption of AI by businesses, it was inevitable firms would attempt to achieve a competitive advantage via this technology. Applications for reducing cost and maximizing value have manifested across a diverse set of industries. However, the wide range of use cases makes it difficult to understand the complete effect of AI on the competitive relationship between businesses. Already, businesses use AI in a plethora of frontstage functions that are relevant for the consumers interacting with them and the workers that design them. Below are examples of some of the most significant users of AI technology: 3.2.1 Media Perhaps no industry is more concerned with its front-stage activities than the media industry. With the success of their products and services depending mainly on consumer perceptions, it makes sense for firms within the industry to utilize new technology to help ensure success. Even in its current state, AI is capable of generating content for media firms (Global Artificial Intelligence, 2019). It could also be used to modify existing content, through methods such as mimicking actor’s performances in a foreign language (Toonkel, Sharma, 2023). AI could also be implemented in other front-stage functions. HBO has held discussions with OpenAI about the potential for using AI-generated descriptions of shows to display online (Toonkel, Sharma, 2023). Within streaming sites, the technology also has the ability to curate the user experience through recommendation algorithms. This has the benefit of creating individual user profiles that can be used as the basis for delivering the necessary content to attract and retain users. However, the potential usage of AI has garnered massive backlash within the media industry. The ongoing writers’ and actors’ strikes were in part caused by the fear that the technology would claim jobs and justify worsened working conditions. The challenge for leaders and workers within the media industry for the foreseeable future will be to settle on agreements regulating artificial intelligence usage. This will be key in leveraging the benefits of the technology while ensuring the industry can maintain relationships with its partners. 3.2.2 Tech The technology industry has been leveraging advancements in AI to assist in the innovative process. Firms are using this technology to create customer personas and create front stage systems, such as user interfaces, optimized through AI. The collection of data also helps technology firms design products better suited to customer demands, which has the potential to drive significant sales (Global Artificial Intelligence, 2019). The success of these data-driven initiatives has led firms to attempt to collect as much data as possible, but some studies have suggested that this activity eventually leads to diminishing returns. Strategy in tech must be based on the quality and relativity of the data rather than just on the volume of data. In the tech industry, research has shown that the use of deep learning is much more accurate where the data sets are massive. However, research shows that this might not always be true. Herein, the systems developed to articulate data find it difficult to make any sense of “start data”. This data is often referred to as cold data which is too small to derive any meaningful explanation. However, as more data comes in, generally referred to as the “power-law” data, each additional data point helps to improve the performance of the algorithm. After a point, any additional data will not be of significant help to the algorithm (Iansiti, 2021). 3.2.3 Retail In the retail industry, artificial intelligence is being utilized for customer-centered strategy. This would mean the use of various front-end targeting mechanisms such as the dynamic pricing mechanism, customer centric assortment optimization, and demand forecasting and planning. Dynamic pricing also works in tandem with the promotion optimization algorithm which helps determine what promotions should reach which customers (Hetu, 2022). AI is also increasingly leveraged in the Best-Fit Apparel algorithm which facilitates the customer in buying according to their style. It is evident that in order to stay competitive in the retail industry, companies must facilitate their operations through AI. This system is especially important in e-commerce due to the previously mentioned feedback loop. To attract enough users to sustain the business, firms like Amazon and Alibaba invest in them to attract users. As more buyers and sellers utilize their platforms, the feedback loop begins as new sources of data are now available. This is in part what makes e-commerce firms successful. Having consumer data they can analyze with AI and market accordingly. One of the most effective ways retail businesses deploy AI is by upselling and cross-selling. These AI systems also have the benefit of being relatively easy to implement. In e-commerce, algorithms can be used to detect a competitor’s price and adjust one’s own accordingly (Hamer, Elliot, Hare, 2023). AI pricing is not limited only to online retailers though. Walmart has been testing robots that scan shelves to calculate stock and determine prices accordingly. In addition to serving as an example of price management, this system also shows how AI can limit the burden of work on employees who are now free to focus more on curating the in-store customer experience (Global Artificial Intelligence, 2019). AI Use-Case Prism for Short Life Cycle Retail, 2022 3.3 Applications of AI 3.3.1 Customer Service “AI can help to improve customer service by automating routine tasks and providing personalized recommendations.” Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft AI has already made significant inroads into customer service, with tools like chatbots and virtual assistants taking on a variety of customer-related tasks. Industry experts are predicting a number of trends in this area. The adoption of AI-powered chatbots is set to rise, with the global chatbot market projected to reach a substantial USD 27,297.2 million by 2030. This growth is expected to occur at a compound annual rate of 23.3% from 2023 to 2030. (Taylor, 2023) The advantages of chatbots are 24/7 availability and efficient handling of inquiries compared to human representatives. As chatbots continue to evolve, they are becoming increasingly sophisticated, capable of addressing both straightforward queries and complex issues. This advancement is proving to be important for customer service teams seeking streamlined interactions. The progression of AI is also leading to a shift towards more personalized customer experiences. Insights from the State of AI report underscore that people are growing more comfortable with AI’s ability to offer personalized messages (50%) and tailored experiences (46%) (Taylor, 2023). Leveraging customer data, AI is now capable of providing customized product recommendations and interactions that enrich the overall customer journey. Furthermore, AI’s predictive capabilities are expected to become more advanced. With enhanced accuracy, AI will be able to predict customer behaviors with precision, resulting in improved customer experiences and heightened satisfaction levels. For instance, AI systems can anticipate when a customer is likely to make a purchase based on their historical behavior and interactions. This predictive ability opens the door for timely actions, such as delivering personalized offers at opportune moments. Debates about AI’s role in customer service will continue. While some analysts envision AI completely replacing human representatives, others anticipate a collaborative relationship between AI and human agents. Research data indicates that by 2024, approximately 61% of customer service professionals will rely on AI or other automated processes. (Taylor, 2023) Although AI excels at handling a diverse range of queries, situations demanding human empathy and understanding are expected to persist. These ongoing discussions reflect the evolving landscape of customer service and the dynamic interplay between technology and human expertise. The State of AI 2023 Report 3.3.2 Marketing “As AI continues to evolve, we can expect to see more intelligent automation in marketing, making it easier and faster to reach our audience. The possibilities are endless, and the future of marketing looks very exciting.” Neil Patel, Co-founder of NP Digital The future of AI in marketing holds transformative potential across a range of aspects, extending from enhancing customer engagement to refining content creation strategies. Marketers are actively exploring innovative methods to interact with consumers and leverage the capabilities of AI to their advantage. However, there are disparities in the advancement of this industry, with larger corporations leading AI integration due to their substantial resources and expertise. Moving into the next decade, substantial advancements and challenges are anticipated in the realm of AI marketing. Firstly, the analysis of consumer behavior through AI-driven methods presents a valuable opportunity for gaining accurate insights into data. This allows marketers to identify trends, optimize their campaigns, and track the return on investment based on a more personalized comprehension of their customers. The potential for real-time inferencing support through AI-powered analytic tools further enhances the effective utilization of consumer data (Wolinsky, 2023). Moreover, advanced AI systems are positioned to process vast quantities of customer data, interpreting emerging patterns and predicting their evolution in real time (Wolinsky, 2023). This predictive analysis will significantly refine marketing campaigns, granting marketers a higher level of precision when evaluating the effectiveness of their efforts. Addressing the growing demand for personalized content curation, AI-powered tools are on the rise. These tools can efficiently curate content tailored to specific platforms and products, resulting in reduced lead times and heightened execution accuracy (Wolinsky, 2023). This shift empowers marketers to attain more measurable outcomes, make strategic adjustments, and effectively engage their target audiences. With the ongoing digital transformation, the need for dependable on-demand customer service has experienced a sharp and significant increase. While automated solutions like chatbots have improved response times, challenges persist in effectively resolving customer concerns. Ongoing development in natural language processing (NLP) models is set to bridge this gap, enhancing the capacity of automated systems to understand and address complex customer queries (Wolinsky, 2023). Voice recognition technology, in conjunction with AI applications such as Alexa and Siri, is expected to elevate the role of language in marketing. Real-time applications of these technologies can optimize voice searches and enhance the comprehension of natural language, thereby fostering improved communication and engagement with consumers (Wolinsky, 2023). AI-driven automation is set to revolutionize digital marketing workflows. It can improve productivity, manage project deliveries, enhance market insights, and generate more personalized messaging. However, AI does not replace human creativity, which is still essential for the successful execution of these strategies. 3.3.3 Talent Management “Cognitive computing is going to be the next big thing in human resource management. It is going to transform how we hire, train, and retain employees.” - Ginni Rometty, Former CEO of IBM Generative AI has the potential to transform recruiting by assisting managers in creating better job requirements and personalizing outreach to candidates. It can identify the skills needed for success in a job, which improves both the speed and quality of the process. Organizations currently struggle to personalize outreach to a large number of applicants. AI can also enhance candidate outreach and communication, making it easier to provide important information to applicants in a more personalized manner (Hancock, 2023). “With generative AI, you can include much more personalization about the candidate, the job, and what other jobs may be available if there’s a reason the applicant isn’t a fit. All those things are made immensely easier and faster through generative AI.” - Bryan Hancock AI’s role in talent evaluation is equally significant, as it can accelerate the shift from credentials to skills-based assessment (Hancock, 2023). The technology’s ability to tag unstructured data for keywords can help identify relevant capabilities and skills, enabling a more inclusive and skills-based approach to candidate evaluation, enriching the pool of potential candidates and promoting a more comprehensive view of skills. Beyond the initial recruitment phase, AI-driven career development assistance emerges as a valuable resource for employees seeking to navigate their professional paths (Hancock, 2023). AI-powered assistants can guide individuals by offering insights into potential career opportunities, identifying role models, and highlighting necessary skills for advancement. This dynamic interaction facilitates informed decision-making and strategic planning for career growth. While AI’s potential is considerable, its role in performance review processes is complex. Although AI could play a role in drafting initial performance reviews based on aggregated feedback, the importance of human judgment and empathy in finalizing these reviews remains undeniable (Schaninger, 2023). This emphasizes the interplay between technological support and the inherently human elements of feedback and assessment. As organizations adopt generative AI tools, leaders need to consider the impact on workflows, collaboration models, and job roles. Proper change management strategies should be employed to maximize the benefits of the technology without disrupting the work ecosystem (Yee, 2023). “The other thing is there’s a real opportunity for what we typically call ‘change management.’ If you don’t think through how the technology changes the job, workflow, or collaboration model, then you’re not necessarily directing that additional time toward something that’s more value added.” - Lareina Yee 3.4 Major Players’ Use of AI: 3.4.1 Alibaba: Alibaba is a Chinese corporation that started out as an e-commerce business back in 1999 and is one of the largest e-commerce websites. Having both a Business to Customer (B2C) arm as well as a Business to Business (B2B) arm, Alibaba has a massive collection of data at its helm. In fact, it has more data than any other retailer, beating Amazon and Walmart. To achieve this, Alibaba leveraged the use of AI since the very beginning. Back in 2009, to predict the traffic on the website on a festival called Singles Day, Alibaba reinvented its AI algorithm to predict traffic based on the data collected in the previous week. This short-term forecasting strategy helped Alibaba to accurately predict the footfall on the website and thus serve the customers with greater efficiency. This also helped the e-commerce website to tackle the problem of irregular shopping cycles by using predictive analysis of data from the previous weeks to manage the footfall. Another use-case of AI at Alibaba is its customer service chatbot, AliMe. To shed some light on the numbers, this chatbot responded to 300 million queries in a single day which accounted for 97% of all customer queries. To put the efficiency brought to operational costs into perspective, it would have taken 85,000 human employees to address this volume of queries (ADA editorial, 2022). AliMe has several abilities such as speech recognition, semantic understanding, and personalized recommendations. AliMe also uses deep learning to direct customers to the best-fit product or service. 3.4.2 Amazon: Amazon is a multinational corporation with several arms including an e-commerce website, a streaming service, and a cloud service. In 2014, Amazon moved towards using deep learning for recommendation engines. This marked the advancement of Amazon towards AI, which is now deeply ingrained in its DNA. Amazon uses artificial intelligence from the moment a customer gets on its website. Talking about the e-commerce shopping arm, Amazon uses consumer data from several sources to customize the landing page of its website for each of the 300 million users that it caters to (V K, 2022). Using this algorithm, it displays those products that customers are most likely to buy. Another area where Amazon used widely available data to cater to customers is the development of its own personal assistant, Alexa. Using algorithms such as voice recognition and natural language processing, it first developed Echo, which is a smart home device that shares information through natural conversation. Developing Alexa was a step forward which helped Amazon use natural conversation throughout its platforms, including streaming and music services. 3.4.3 Starbucks: Starbucks is the third largest fast food chain in the entire world and is spread over 30,000 locations (V K, 2022). Starbucks started its AI program as late as 2018 when it started to harvest the data made available through the 90 million customer transactions daily throughout the globe. Using this massive bank of data, Starbucks made better decisions in sales and overall direction of the corporation. A specific use-case was improving their direct marketing technologies such as targeted advertising and personalized drink recommendations. With the data of 13 million customers in its loyalty program, Starbucks began offering customized drinks according to customer preferences (V K, 2022). They also used the widely available data to recommend preferred drinks to customers who have never visited a Starbucks before. Another use-case of AI at Starbucks is the availability of a virtual barista to facilitate the ordering experience. "],["regulation-of-ai.html", "Chapter 4 Regulation of AI 4.1 Current regulation 4.2 Proposed regulation 4.3 Regulation as a competitive advantage", " Chapter 4 Regulation of AI AI technology has been making major advances with AI systems, such as ChatGPT, being used by over 40% of college students in the United States (Balderson, 2023). Companies and organizations all around the world are increasing their use of AI to gain a competitive advantage in their respective industries. This race of AI technology is putting focus on what regulation needs to be developed to control these advances. AI is becoming a core part of political discourse, and big names in the tech industry such as Steve Wozniak, Elon Musk, and politicians such as Andrew Yang, have signed an open letter asking for a moratorium on AI experimentation for regulation development (Pause Giant AI experiments: An open letter, 2023). While this open letter has not led to any action, it does bring attention to the fact that governments will have to focus a large part of their future legislation on regulation. AI systems and regulations are global and inter-industry issues. There are so many different pieces, in different industries, and they’re all moving at different paces, which makes it difficult to legislate. 4.1 Current regulation Governments around the world have only scratched the surface on legislating AI regulation. Most countries, like the United States, are still debating what parts of AI should be regulated, and how much regulation is appropriate. There are a few exceptions to this trend. The European Parliament has recently taken its first step to legal regulation by passing a draft law named the AI Act. This act will focus on limiting the most high-risk parts of AI technology, such as facial recognition. It will also force upcoming AI systems to be more open about the data they are using. While this is only a draft law, the final version of this law is expected to be passed by the end of 2023, making it one of the first large steps toward government-enforced AI regulation (Satariano, 2023). 4.2 Proposed regulation AI regulations are slowly starting to be put into effect, but there are still so many questions on how it will work. The CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, wrote a testimony to the Senate this May asking that they start strongly considering regulating artificial intelligence (Hendrix, 2023). He proposed solutions such as licensing companies to use AI, or creating a government agency strictly responsible for AI regulation. Altman’s solutions were questioned by some, though, as there are still many disagreements about what the best way to legislate AI should be. While these solutions seem good on paper, the answer to how to regulate AI is not that simple. Officials are predicting that AI regulation agencies have the potential of being compromised. Having only one small sector of government responsible for such a broad and important issue could lead to bias. Experts have recommended that AI needs to be diversely regulated by a combination of different agencies and organizations. They have said that regulation should be created by a collaboration from academia, policy experts, industry experts, and even international agencies (Susarla, 2023). New strategies for AI regulation are being proposed regularly by CEOs and other big names in the tech field. AI technology is progressing rapidly and there is an understanding of the need to regulate it before it gets bigger, faster, and stronger. While most tech officials are in agreement about the importance of regulation, government officials can often be harder to come by. The median age of the U.S. The House of Representatives is 58 years old, and the median age is 65 years old in the Senate. The United States lawmaker demographic is much older than the mean age in America (38 years old) (Blazina and DeSilver, 2023). Their age could mean they have lesser knowledge or insight into these new technological advancements than young, up-and-coming workers in the tech industry do. The lawmakers’ lack of understanding of artificial intelligence applications can lead to more debate than needed on what type of regulation should be established. These are prime years to establish effective regulations on artificial intelligence and how it is used. Setting regulations now, when AI is not overwhelmingly powerful, could be key to getting a grasp on this technology and its future that we cannot predict. Some places, like the European Union, are taking their first steps toward government action, but others, like the United States, have barely scratched the surface. While companies are already beginning to integrate AI regulation into their business, not every organization will follow suit without government intervention. AI Regulation should be expected to be a hot topic in government and politics in the near future since AI will continue to progress and the demand for regulation will increase with it. 4.3 Regulation as a competitive advantage AI use within companies is becoming increasingly normalized in numerous industries - leading to a higher mistrust in AI and AI regulation among customers and employees of these companies. So much of what artificial intelligence is can be difficult for the average individual to grasp. For some people, the first thing they think of when they hear “AI” is horror stories of technology taking over the world. Acknowledging these individuals and understanding their views is a step that some companies have already started to take. 4.3.1 Pros Responsible AI is a process that certain companies have acquired to regulate their own use of AI. It is the process of developing AI systems that minimizes biases, enforces data security, ensures transparency within companies, and creates opportunities for employees to speak out on their concerns on AI use. Companies using this form of AI regulation have actually found that it can be used as a competitive advantage. Currently, 36% of organizations have said they believe it will create opportunities for competitive differentiation (Eitel-Porter, 2023). The ability to deliver trustworthy AI systems that are regulation-ready can help a company attract new customers because they are using AI safely and are being transparent about its use. While this is a step in the right direction, AI regulation needs to be supported by governments to truly make a difference. 4.3.2 Cons While there are obvious benefits to regulating the use of AI, there are also a number of setbacks that could have a negative effect. Limiting its capabilities or room for growth could lead to artificial intelligence not having the ability or flexibility to adapt or learn in positive ways. Strict regulations could restrain creativity and innovation, and lessen the amount of risks taken by companies. This also could become a problem in relation to international affairs. Companies within countries that set stricter regulations will suffer in comparison to companies rooted in countries that have more flexible AI control (Balderson, 2023).

The MBAn curriculum prepares students with both the technical skills and business acumen to lead in AI-driven business domains. Executives are finding themselves facing a set of realities including untapped opportunity and existential risks (Ransbotham, 2019). As businesses invest in AI-driven operations, students with a strong understanding of technology, strategy, and leadership will be in high demand for executive roles with AI decision making. 5.2 Meeting the demand for AI-proficient leaders and strategists The market is craving strong decision-makers with knowledge bases in AI. Although there is a current surplus of technical leaders like software engineers and data scientists, the biggest challenge is finding people with business expertise to contribute to AI strategy. After all, companies cannot solve strategy problems with AI without people who truly understand the underlying business goals at hand. (Yuval, 2023) 5.3 The AI Landscape in Corporate Strategy In the current AI landscape, success is derived from harnessing its vast potential to enhance efficiency, foster innovation, and secure a competitive advantage. These advantages can only be realized if executives adopt and scale AI practices in their company in an effective manner. 5.4 Cultural and Structural Obstacles to AI Integration The integration of artificial intelligence into the corporate ecosystem is a compelling value proposition for any company. However, only “8% of firms engage in core practices that support widespread adoption of AI and advanced analytics (Harvard Business Review, 2020)”. Just “12% of the executives and senior executives have included AI initiatives in their corporate strategies.” (Mostafa, 2023) Even with so much to gain from the integration of AI, many organizations find themselves faced with cultural and structural barriers. 5.4.1 Misperceptions The polarizing nature of the discourse surrounding AI has led to hesitancy in its implementation and adoption. When executives think about automating strategy, many are looking too far ahead, focusing on how AI would completely replace business leaders and their decision-making. Shifting their focus to the use of AI as “building blocks” of their corporate strategy could significantly improve their business outcomes (Yuval, 2023). Another misconception is the expectation of instant rewards from AI as simply a plug-and-play solution. Even when AI is adopted as a business strategy, it has a constrained use case, which limits its versatility and curtails its ultimate potential (Harvard Business Review, 2020). 5.4.2 Cultural Reluctance The nuances of human behavior play critical roles in AI’s corporate integration. Humans are resistant to change by nature, especially when it disrupts long-established tried and true norms. Changes in a business setting are no exception. Many established organizations operate on top-down decision-making. Transitioning to a model where decisions are reinforced by AI represents an upending structural and cultural shift from intuition-based CEO decision-making to a flattened organizational structure backed by data-reinforced conclusions. (Mostafa, 2023). Overlaying these challenges is the undercurrent of the fear of the unknown. There is anxiety over job losses and reduced human significance. McKinsey highlights the issue directly: “The big challenge is finding strategists to contribute to the AI effort. You are asking people to get involved in an initiative that may make their jobs less important (Yuval, 2023).” 5.5 Overcoming Barriers to Entry Incorporating artificial intelligence into corporate strategy requires a holistic approach. There are key considerations necessary to ensure a smooth transition into an AI-integrated business. 5.5.1 Enhanced Human-AI Interactions The incorporation of AI into the business world is a symbiotic relationship that demands continual human feedback for improvement (Degnan, 2023). Companies must also embrace diverse teams with varying skills and perspectives to ensure that AI solutions cater to a wide span of organizational needs. After all, the only way to maximize the potential of a data-driven technology like AI is to accommodate it with many diverse inputs (Harvard Business Review, 2020). 5.5.2 Culture Evolution Effective implementation of AI in businesses means transitioning the corporate culture to embrace AI rather than just accepting it (Degnan, 2023). In addition to a deliberate reception of AI, an organization’s attitude towards its deployment should be dynamic and iterative. By valuing continuous feedback and experimentation, organizations can develop robust AI solutions that can operate at scale. Notably, almost 90% of companies successful in scaling AI practices allocated more than half of their analytics budgets to adoption-centric activities - emphasizing the importance of company-wide cultural shifts (Harvard Business Review, 2020). 5.5.3 Alignment with Core Objectives AI should resonate with a company’s mission and objectives. For example, Southwest Airlines emphasizes low-cost airfare. Their AI strategies amplify those core beliefs and provide customer value consistent with the company’s values (Degnan, 2023). 5.5.4 Consistent Evaluation Successful AI integration requires consistent performance monitoring. Companies should develop a robust set of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure how closely the AIs contributions continue to align with core objectives and provide tangible value (Degnan, 2023). By addressing these tenets of AI strategy, organizations can pave the way to seamless integration and success - with MBAn students leading the way. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 6 Conclusion", " Chapter 6 Conclusion The MBAn student body and the business community as a whole stand on the precipice of a new age of commerce. The benefits provided by AI have allowed firms across numerous industries to improve on their processes both internal and external. According to a global survey by McKinsey, a significant portion of executives from companies that have adopted AI report an increase in revenue in the business areas it influenced. Specifically, 63% of respondents claimed a revenue boost from AI integration. AI’s potential to optimize company-wide operations also translates into significant cost savings. McKinsey’s report highlights that 44% of the executives observed a reduction in costs due to the adoption of AI in their business operations (McKinsey Company, 2019). Business students should consider AI’s current impact and its future so they may thrive as tomorrow’s leaders. Yet, this is a task easier said than done; with so many industries applying AI in so many ways, it is difficult to understand such a revolutionary technology via a holistic analysis. This report has mainly focused on front-stage elements in a few key industries that individuals are likely to interact with as workers and consumers. It is also important to acknowledge that students are not the only ones struggling to understand the impact of AI. There is an immense need for regulation, and it falls on business leaders informed on the issue to guide governments toward effective policies. This is especially important considering the conflict between managers, workers, and technology that is ongoing. MBAn students therefore face a dual responsibility. The first is to research AI applications to build more efficient businesses. The second is to develop systems of control for AI so that it does not have an adverse impact on consumers or businesses. The journey of integrating AI into the business landscape, while promising transformative benefits, has many challenges. Understanding and addressing these obstacles is necessary for any future executive looking to harness AI’s full potential in their organization.
