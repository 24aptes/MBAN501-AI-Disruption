# Introduction

The transformative power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is profoundly altering the landscape of competition in the global marketplace. Beyond the day-to-day operations, AI is redefining strategic visions and changing the very foundation of competitive advantage.

**The Traditional Face of Competition**

Historically, competition has been largely defined by the people, processes, and technology capabilities that a company possesses. Those with the most advanced technology, the most skilled personnel, and the most efficient processes typically held the upper hand. This dynamic view of competition was a zero-sum game, with winners taking all while others strived to catch up.

**The Emerging Landscape of Competition**

However, the advent of AI has triggered a dramatic shift in this traditional paradigm. Competition is no longer solely about resource superiority. In fact, resource-based view of competition is being challenged as smaller companies with fewer resources are leveraging AI to carve out their own niches and compete with established giants.

**Leadership in the Age of AI**

The changing dynamics of competition necessitate a shift in leadership styles as well. To effectively navigate this new landscape, leaders need to shift from being excellent individual contributors to strategic visionaries who can guide their firms towards successful adaptation and innovation.

**AI: Managing the Craze**

AI's potential has led to a "craze" among businesses, with organizations across sectors rushing to adopt these technologies. However, managing this craze effectively is crucial to ensure that AI serves as a genuine competitive advantage and not just a fad.

**New Strategic Questions**

As we stand at this intersection of AI, regulation, and competition, numerous strategic questions arise. How can firms best leverage AI while navigating regulatory requirements? How can they maintain a competitive edge in a landscape where resource possession is not the only key to success? Answering these open strategic questions calls for exploring new organizational and strategic designs.

Through the lens of AI regulation, this book aims to delve into these critical questions, offering insights on how to harness AI's power effectively and ethically in the marketplace of the future.
