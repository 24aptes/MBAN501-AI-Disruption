We plan to study the issue from three perspectives: executives, managers, and employees. It is a collaborative effort by Manav Adwani, Sohil Apte, Lauren Brown, Anson Lee, and Xuexin Li. For executives, we want to ask: How are businesses responding to the rise of generative AI? Is AI offering tangible benefits? What are the risks of adopting AI systems too early or too late? For managers, we want to ask: How do teams determine if AI should be used on a project? If so, how is it implemented? Will this impact standards for team performance? For employees, we want to ask: How will the nature of work change with generative AI? Are anxieties about being replaced by AI valid? What does this mean for those entering the workforce, particularly Ross students? The goal of this project is to understand what AI will accomplish in the next few years. Using these guiding questions, the team will research AI’s impact at all levels of a business. Our conclusions should create a holistic picture of AI’s potential and the consequences of its adoption.
