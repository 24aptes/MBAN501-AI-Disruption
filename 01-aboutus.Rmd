We are a team of Master of Business Analytics (MBAn) students with the goal of understanding how the new age of generative artificial intelligence (AI) will impact the world, and specifcally, impact our cohort as analytics students. By combining our wide array of backrounds, diverse skillsets, and range of persepctives, we hope to compile a robust report that captures the impact AI will have on all levels of industry.

## Team Reflection

The culture of MBAngels evolved significantly over the course of the project. In the initial stages, our team was not a strong one, and our lack of coordination was apparent on our first in-class presentation. The disjointed nature of the assignment made it apparent we were not truly working as a team, and Professor Domagala made note of this when giving feedback. As a result, we decided to devote our next meeting to serious team-building to ensure our final project would be of a higher quality. Our first step was to ensure all members had a basic understanding of how to push to Git, so that we could all participate in writing the report. This was a long and frustrating process as we encountered numerous technical issues along the way, but eventually we were all able to make necessary changes to the website. 

Additionally, this meeting helped us build a culture and though not the intention of the meeting, helped establish psychological safety. By helping one another with RStudio, our team established norms for requesting and receiving help. MBAngels welcomed the statement “I don’t know how to solve this problem; I need help,” because it helped start discussions and ensured all members contributed to the overall progress. Our subsequent meetings also saw greater participation over time. To contrast with our initial, uncoordinated presentation, the final stages of this project saw our team read each section aloud as a group to check for errors, inconsistencies, or areas of improvement. The result has been a project that we are truly proud of, and we hope that Professor Domagala and Professor Kumar note our evolution as a team.
